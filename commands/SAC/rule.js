username#discriminator roles: These are personal roles for Nitro Boosters to change their name color!
${starRole}: This role does nothing. It is granted to users who significantly help the server out or are otherwise pillars of the community.
${ShinxPlayerRole}, ${ShinxTORole}, ${DraftRole}: Correspond to certain Pokémon events we hold here every now and then and open up corresponding channel categories.
${ventRole}: Opens up #vent-chat. This chat is only for serious topics, abuse of or ridiculing conversation in this channel will get your ass kicked.
${heRole}, ${sheRole}, ${theyRole}: Let everyone know your pronouns. These also unlock some general chats like #irl-pics since maintaining a list of all game roles for each of these channels is annoying.
${stanRole}: Takes you into consideration for ${client.user}'s daily random stanning.
${botHostRole}: The nice people who host our Sysbots.
If a role is not listed here it is either useless (aside from the color), very obvious from the name alone or so niche it is not worth displaying here. Ask a mod about these if you have questions.`,

-You get a special role (${boosterRole}) and the boosting icon next to your name. 
-You are also able to create your own personal colored role using \`?personalrole <colorhex>\` in ${botChannel}.
-You should get queue priority in our Pokémon bots. (Experimental)`,

These roles will unlock the bot specific channel (${PKMBotchannel} for PKM ${ACNHBotChannel} for ACNH).
Go there and read the pins there for more instructions.

Please don't ask dumb questions like "When will x bot will be online???". The bot hosts in this server are doing so in their free time without expecting anything in return (though donations are appreciated), bots are on when available. 
${PKMBotRole} and/or ${ACNHBotRole} role will be pinged when bots go online. You can check bot status at any time using \`?sysbot\`.
If you want more uptime/consistency refer to the paypal links in the pins of ${botChannel} to donate money to me and fund me more hardware to run more bots on at the same time.`,
